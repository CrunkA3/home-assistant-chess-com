# home-assistant-chess-com

Chess.com integration for Home Assistant — connect a Chess.com account to surface live game information, ratings, and recent activity on your smart home dashboard.

## Overview

This custom integration allows Home Assistant users to:

- Display current rating and game statistics on dashboards
- Show ongoing games or recent results as part of a household activity feed
- Trigger automations based on Chess.com events (e.g., starting a game changes a light scene, finishing a match sends a notification)

The goal is to make Chess.com activity an interactive element of the home environment.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant (core)
- This repository added as a custom integration (or installed via HACS if packaged)
- A Chess.com username
